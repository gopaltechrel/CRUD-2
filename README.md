What is CRUD?
CRUD represents the four basic operations of persistent storage: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

These operations form the backbone of most web applications, allowing users to interact with and manipulate data stored in databases or other storage systems.

Create: Add new records or data.
Read: Retrieve or view existing data.
Update: Modify existing data.
Delete: Remove existing data.
